                <br>
Ingredients:
<br>
<br>
•2 cups long-grain Basmati rice<br> 
•500g chicken, lamb, or vegetables (your choice)<br> 
•2 large onions, thinly sliced<br> 
•2 tomatoes, chopped<br> 
•1/2 cup plain yogurt<br> 
•2-3 green chilies, slit<br> 
•2-3 cloves of garlic, minced<br> 
•1-inch piece of ginger, minced<br> 
•A handful of fresh mint leaves<br> 
•A handful of fresh coriander leaves<br> 
•2-3 tablespoons cooking oil or ghee (clarified butter)<br> 
•Whole spices (bay leaves, cloves, cardamom, cinnamon sticks)<br> 
•Ground spices (turmeric, red chili powder, garam masala)<br> 
•Saffron strands soaked in warm milk for coloring and flavor<br> 
•Salt to taste<br> 
<br>
Instructions:
<br>  
<br>                    
1.Wash and soak the rice in water for 30 minutes. Drain and set aside.
<br>                    
2.In a large, heavy-bottomed pan, heat the oil or ghee over medium heat.Add the whole spices (bay leaves, cloves, cardamom, and cinnamon) and sauté for a minute until they release their aroma.
<br>                    
3.Add the sliced onions and fry them until they turn golden brown and crispy.Remove some of the fried onions and set them aside for garnishing.
<br>                    
4.Add the minced ginger and garlic, green chilies, and chopped tomatoes to the pan.Cook until the tomatoes become soft and the oil starts to separate.
<br>                      
5.Add your choice of meat or vegetables and cook for a few minutes until they are lightly browned.
<br>                      
6.Add the yogurt, mint leaves, and half of the coriander leaves. Stir well and cook for a few more minutes.
<br>                      
7.Sprinkle the ground spices (turmeric, red chili powder, garam masala) and salt. Stir to combine.
<br>                      
8.Add the soaked and drained rice to the pot and gently mix everything together.
<br>                      
9.Pour in enough water to cook the rice (approximately 3-4 cups of water). Bring it to a boil, then reduce the heat to low, cover the pot, and let it simmer until the rice is cooked and the meat is tender. You can also use the dum cooking method by sealing the pot's lid with dough to trap steam.
<br>                      
10.While the biryani is cooking, drizzle the saffron milk over the top and garnish with the reserved fried onions and coriander leaves.
<br>                      
11.Once cooked, let the biryani rest for a few minutes before serving. Fluff the rice gently with a fork and serve hot with raita or salan (a spicy gravy).
